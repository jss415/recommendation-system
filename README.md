## recommendation-system


This project uses the MovieLens dataset to develop and compare various algorithms for movie recommendation and rating prediction. We evaluate the performance of different approaches including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), content-based filtering, item-to-item K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), user-based filtering, hybrid methods, and neural filtering. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are used to assess the effectiveness of each algorithm. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method, helping to identify the best strategies for accurate movie recommendations.
